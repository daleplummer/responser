#  responser (original author unknown)
#
#  Checks servers by looking at a server web site.  If the site
#  responds then the server is assumed to be up.  If the site
#  is down then email is sent.  There are two (!) config files
#  used to specify what sites to monitor and where to send email
#  (see "Program Settings" below.)
#
#  Schedule this with a cron job, e.g.
#  $ crontab -e
#     55 * * * * /home/dalep/responser/responser.pl
#  This will run responser.pl at 55 minutes past the hour for every
#  hour of every day.
